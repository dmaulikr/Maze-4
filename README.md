# Maze
Get out a maze randomly
My initial thought was to use a recursive method to solve the maze and compare adjacent row and column values 
but instead I decided to go with a kind of blind squirrel algorithm.  Completely random!  
I chose this mainly because I was curious how many moves it would take to exit a simple maze using this method.
